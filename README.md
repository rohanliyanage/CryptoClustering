# CryptoClustering
Challenge 19 

In this Challenge 19, you’ll use your knowledge of Python programming and new unsupervised learning to predict
if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The CSV file provided for this challenge 
contains price change data of cryptocurrencies in different periods.

The steps for this challenge are :

•	Import the Data [in the starter code]

•	Prepare the Data

•	Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data.

•	Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data

•	Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis.

•	Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

•	Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

•	Visualise and Compare the Results
